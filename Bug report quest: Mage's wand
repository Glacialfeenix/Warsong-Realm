*When it occured: 19:30 European time roughly (1.5 hour ago from writing this)
*Description: I need to get Icefury Wand for raiding molten core, and it's rewarded from a mage quest: Mage's Wand. 
The problem is that it's a 3 quest chain. It starts with a quest from the mage trainer to go see Tabatha in Dustwallow Marsh. 
Then she gives you Items of power and you have to do some things around the world, I did this quest.
Then after turning it in she should give you the next quest, Rituals of power. 
The problem is she didnt have this quest. I checked multiple places like Tanaris, which she sends you to, but it's not there either.
Ive done this quest a couple times before on other servers so I know she should give it.
Also other mages in my guild did the quest just fine and she gave Rituals of power to them.

I really dont know what to do now but I really want that wand because it's very strong for MC entry raiding.









*How it works: Handed in Items of power quest, she gave no Rituals of power quest follow up.
*How it should work: Hand in items of power quest, gives rituals of power follow up quest.

Please help me.. I dont know if u guys can just make the quest appear in my quest log, which would be amazing. 
I did the quest before it so i dont think its unfair..

Thanks
